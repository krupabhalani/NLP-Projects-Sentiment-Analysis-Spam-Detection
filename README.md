# NLP-Projects-Sentiment-Analysis-Spam-Detection

Description:
Executed two major Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects focused on sentiment classification and spam detection, gaining end-to-end experience in text preprocessing, feature extraction, model building, and evaluation.

(1) Corona Sentiment Analysis

Cleaned and normalized text data using regex, TextBlob, and NLTK, removing noise such as punctuation, emojis, and stop words.

Extracted meaningful features with TF-IDF Vectorization and applied machine learning models including Logistic Regression, SVM, and Decision Tree.

Classified tweets and text reviews into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment categories with strong model performance.

(2) Spam Detection System

Performed data cleaning by handling duplicates, missing values, and irrelevant content.

Applied text preprocessing techniques such as case normalization, HTML/URL removal, stop word elimination, spelling correction, and stemming.

Implemented Bag of Words (BoW) and TF-IDF for feature representation and trained multiple classifiers â€” Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVC, KNN, Decision Tree.

Evaluated models using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report, identifying optimal algorithms for spam detection.

Tech Stack: Python, scikit-learn, NLTK, TextBlob, pandas, NumPy
